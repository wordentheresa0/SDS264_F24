# Welcome to My Website!

My name is Theresa Worden. I am a current senior at St. Olaf College majoring in computer science and mathematics. My passion and previous professional experience lies within the world of software development. Outside of work and academia, I am an amateur boxer, and I am currently training for my first fight this winter. Click around my website to learn more about me and my projects.
